you can do it
the sky is blue
the house is big
i like cars
walt is the man
walking on sunshine
eat your foot
bananas have legs
i like turtles
i like eggs
dont mess up
park in the driveway
drive in the parkway
slow and steady
wins the race
quick to the slow
type for your life
grass is green
you wanna fight
the rain is wet
rocks are hard
i love everything
the weather is nice
words have power
unless youre deaf
just keep swimming
dont forget
